# MusicBot

A Python-based Discord Music Bot that allows users to play and manage audio tracks directly from their Discord server. This project leverages Python libraries and Discord’s API to create a seamless music experience, including features such as audio playback, queue management, and basic music commands. Below is an overview of the bot’s capabilities, development setup, and how to get started.

## Project Overview

- **Core Purpose:** Provide a robust and customizable music-playing bot for Discord.
- **Features:**
  - Play music from various sources (e.g., YouTube)
  - Queue and manage multiple songs
  - Basic playback controls (play, pause, skip, stop)
  - Clean and configurable command structure
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Language:** Python
  - **Discord API Integration:** [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) or another relevant library
  - **Dependencies:** Usually includes requests and an audio source library (e.g., youtube_dl/pytube)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leo2971998/MusicBot.git
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   cd MusicBot
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Configuration:**
   - **Create a Discord Application** on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - **Add a Bot User** to your application and copy your Bot Token.
   - **Set Up a Configuration File** (e.g., `.env` or `config.json`) with the following:
     ```
     DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
     ```
5. **Run the Bot:**
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
   - Once the bot is running, invite it to your server using the OAuth2 link from the Developer Portal.

## Bot Commands (Examples)

- **!play [song_name_or_link]:** Plays a specific song, automatically fetching from YouTube or your configured source.
- **!pause:** Pauses current playback.
- **!resume:** Resumes paused playback.
- **!skip:** Skips to the next song in the queue.
- **!queue:** Shows the current list of songs queued.
